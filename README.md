Framework mod combining my old Deconstruct Return Fix and Orbital Trade Hook mods, along with several utility functions. Somewhat of a work-in-progress, will have many more features in the future but playable now.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/dninemfive/d9framework/wiki) for more details.

Don't let the license scare you, just ask for permission and I'll probably let you use some of my code here. I'll be specifically licensing certain classes once I figure out how that works.

## For Modders
This mod is like JecsTools or HugsLib - set this mod as a dependency for your own.
