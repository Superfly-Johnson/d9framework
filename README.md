Framework mod combining my old Deconstruct Return Fix and Orbital Trade Hook mods plus a number of useful Harmony patches and XML-only features. See the [wiki](https://github.com/dninemfive/d9framework/wiki) for a complete list.

Don't let the license scare you, just ask for permission and I'll probably let you use some of my code here. I'll be specifically licensing certain classes once I figure out how that works.

## For Modders
This mod is like JecsTools or HugsLib - set this mod as a dependency for your own. See the [wiki](https://github.com/dninemfive/d9framework/wiki#for-modders) for more details.

I'd love to see anything you make with this! Feel free to message me on Steam or Discord to show off.
